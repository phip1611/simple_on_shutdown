//! This crate consists of a convenient macro to specify on shutdown callbacks.
//! This is useful for all runtimes you do not have control over.
//!
//! The generated main() function of an "actix" web server is a good example. With the
//! exported macro [`on_shutdown`] you can easily specify code, that should run during program
//! termination.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: Use this on the top level of your main() or whatever your current runtimes main
//! function is! The code gets executed when the context it lives in gets dropped.
//! This can be called multiple times (at least with stable Rust 1.48.0) without problem.

//! This crate consists of a convenient macro to specify on shutdown callbacks called [`on_shutdown`].
//! It takes code that should be executed when your program exits (gracefully).
//!
//! Internally it creates a closure that gets executed when the context gets dropped, i.e. when
//! `main()` exits. There is also [`on_shutdown_move`] available in case the closure needs to capture
//! vars, like an `Arc<>`.
//!
//! In theory this macro can be used everywhere where the context gets dropped. But it has a nice
//! expressive name so that one exactly knows what it should achieve in code. A good example
//! is the `main()` function in an `actix-web`-Server. For example you want to log to a file
//! when the server was shut down.
//!
//! There is no guarantee that this gets executed during "non-regular" shutdown scenarios,
//! like when receiving `CTRL+C / SIGINT / SIGTERM`. This depends on whether your application
//! properly handles signals and if the operating system gives your application time before it gets
//! totally killed/stopped.
//!
//! **IMPORTANT**: Use this on the top level of your main() or whatever your current runtimes main
//! function is! The code gets executed when the context it lives in gets dropped.
//! This macro can be called multiple times (at least with stable Rust 1.48.0) without problems.
//!
//! This crate uses the `log` crate on the `debug` level.
